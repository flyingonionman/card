# card

If someone knows how to set up change logs for this shit I would recommend

### 0.01 - Added pretzel and Rod. Added "Add Card to deck" action class which was a pain in this ass. 
#### This means "boon" cards that add cards to your deck is now possible, so are "curse" cards. Idk why the developer didn't put this in as default
